# Fantasy World Builder

## Overview

Fantasy World Builder is a comprehensive full-stack web application for creating and managing fantasy worlds. The application provides extensive lore management capabilities, character development tools, and world-building features with a beautiful dark fantasy-themed interface. It supports multilingual content (Ukrainian and English) and includes real-time synchronization, audio controls, and export functionality.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: 
  - Zustand for global state (language preferences, audio settings)
  - React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: 
  - Radix UI primitives for accessible components
  - UnoCSS for utility-first styling
  - Custom fantasy theme with dark colors and purple/gold accents
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture

- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript for full-stack type safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **File Uploads**: Express-fileupload for handling image uploads
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

### Data Storage Solutions

- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with migrations support
- **Schema**: Comprehensive schema supporting:
  - Users and authentication
  - Worlds and world templates
  - Locations with map coordinates
  - Characters with detailed profiles

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls using React Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle requests and validate data
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM performs type-safe database operations
4. **Response Caching**: React Query caches responses for optimal performance
5. **State Updates**: UI updates automatically based on cached data changes

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies

- Drag and drop (@dnd-kit packages)

### Backend Dependencies
- Express.js framework
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver
- Neon Database serverless driver
- File upload handling (express-fileupload)
- Session management (express-session, connect-pg-simple)

### Development Dependencies
- TypeScript compiler
- Vite build tool
- TSX for development server
- Concurrently for running multiple processes
- ESBuild for server bundling

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with autoscaling:

- **Development**: Concurrent client and server development with hot reloading
- **Build Process**: 
  1. Vite builds the client application
  2. TypeScript compiles server code
  3. ESBuild bundles server for production
- **Production**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- **Assets**: Static files served from Express with file upload support
